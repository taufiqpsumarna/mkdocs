# Hello World

## Introduction

In this post, we'll explore how to automate Docker container image updates using Watchtower. We'll also set up real-time notifications using Mattermost to keep the team informed when updates are triggered.

## Problem Statement

Managing Docker container updates manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is especially true when using Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for image storage.

## Solution

The Watchtower tool can be used to monitor running containers and automatically update them whenever a new image is available. To keep the team informed, we can integrate notifications with Mattermost.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Set Up Watchtower

Install Watchtower on your Docker host:

``` bash
docker run -d \
  --name watchtower \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  containrrr/watchtower
```
